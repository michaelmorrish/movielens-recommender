# MovieLens Recommender

Collaborative filtering-based recommender system using GroupLens' MovieLens data implemented with Python and MySQL

# Abstract

This project utilizes the Python programming language and MySQL Server to build a recommender system. Predictions for movie ratings are made with a user and an unrated movie as the specified inputs. User-based, collaborative filtering techniques discussed in the literature are applied to develop this system. Data from MovieLens is used for this project.

# Important Literature

Literature authored by those connected to the GroupLens/MovieLens projects has been used to inform this project. This literature is available on the Internet:

Herlocker, Jonathan L., Konstan, Joseph A., Borchers, Al, Riedl, John. (1999). An algorithmic framework for performing collaborative filtering. Retrieved April 4, 2016 from http://files.grouplens.org/papers/algs.pdf

# Data

Data used for this project is readily available at no cost on the GroupLens web site. The MovieLens 20M Dataset is the version of the data that has been used here and it may be downloaded from http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ .

# Software Requirements

This project has been developed with Python 2.7.10 and MySQL Community Server 5.7.11. The MySQL Connector/Python has been used to allow these two technologies to work together. These products are available at the following links at no cost.

MySQL Community Server: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

MySQL/Python Connector: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/

iPython Notebooks have also been used and this tool is available through a few sources. The project has recently moved under the Jupyter project. Users of the Anaconda distribution may already have Jupyter. Users of Linux may find iPython available in their Linux repositories. Other users may review the information on this page: http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html to learn the best way to use the notebooks.
